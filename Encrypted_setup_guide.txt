Setup and Use Guide (Encrypted.exe)

A) First-time setup (both laptops)
1) Copy the file Encrypted.exe to both laptops.
2) Run it once. If Windows warns about “unknown publisher,” click More info ? Run anyway.
3) When Windows Firewall asks, allow Private networks (important so LAN connections work).

B) Decide who is the Server (one person)
4) Choose one laptop to be the Server (the listener).
5) On that laptop, open the app and leave:
   - Listen IP = 0.0.0.0 (default)
   - Port = 5050 (or any open port you agree on)
6) Click Start Server.
7) The status should show Listening on 0.0.0.0:5050.

C) Find the Server’s LAN IP
8) On the server laptop, open Command Prompt and run:
   ipconfig
9) Find the IPv4 Address (example: 192.168.1.42).
   This is the IP the other person will connect to.

D) Connect the Client (other laptop)
10) On the other laptop (Client):
    - Connect to IP = server’s IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.42)
    - Port = same port (5050)
11) Click Connect.
12) Status should show Connected to 192.168.1.42:5050.

E) Share the Encryption Key
13) On either laptop, click Generate Key.
14) Click Copy Key.
15) Send the key to the other person (chat, text, etc.).
16) On the other laptop, click Paste Key.
    Both must use the same key to encrypt/decrypt.

F) Send a Message
17) Type a message in the Compose box.
18) Click Encrypt Preview (you’ll see ciphertext).
19) Click Send Message.
20) The message appears in history.

G) Receive & Decrypt
21) The other laptop sees the incoming message in history.
22) Click the message in the list.
23) Click Decrypt Selected to show plaintext.

H) Optional Buttons
- Show Ciphertext: shows raw encrypted data.
- Copy Text: copies whatever is in the detail box.

Troubleshooting
- If connection fails:
  - Make sure both are on the same Wi-Fi.
  - Try disabling firewall temporarily (or allow the app).
  - Check the IP and port are correct.
- If decrypt fails:
  - Ensure both are using the exact same key.
